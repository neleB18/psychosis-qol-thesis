This repository contains all code used for the thesis:

“Predicting One-Year Quality of Life in Psychosis Using Routine Clinical Data:
A Leak-Free Repeated Nested Cross-Validation Study.”

The code implements a fully leak-free, grouped, 10×10 repeated nested cross-validation pipeline to evaluate six machine-learning models on the Altrecht PPP dataset.
The primary target outcome is MANSA (Manchester Short Assessment of Quality of Life).
